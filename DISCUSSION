- Make it reactive. Sandboxed. Functions are unexceptionally immutable.
Procedures DO NOT return values or alter anything other than arguments or
variables inside the scope. I have a crazy idea to make it failsafe by
delegating all erroneous data and/or information to a reactive mechanism.

- There should be no "oh, where did that variable come from?" Think of
something. Maybe we could have something like root and relative paths? Or
links? Per scope? `.` for itself, `..` for parents, `...` for root.

- Apparently, Plain has so much to do with Tcl! I had no idea when I designed
the language. Anyway, this is my own implementation, based on my own philosophy
and ideology, a strange sense of art, style and minimalism.
