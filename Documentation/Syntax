Syntax

    Keyword

        Any sequence of bytes. See Source/Framework/Host/Version.c for reserved
        characters. Keywords "yes", "no" and "none" are immutable.

    Whitespace
        
        Space (0x20), line feed (0x0A), horizontal tab (0x09),
        carriage return (0x0D).

        Can be used, basically, anywhere.

    Comment

        Starts with a grave accent (0x60) and ends with a line feed (0x0A) or a
        carriage return (0x0D).

    Node

        <Keyword> (with or without <Data>), used for statements and expressions
        (see <Semantics>).

        Use whitespaces or commas (0x2C) to separate data.

    List

        Or simply a sequence of nodes. Use semicolons (0x3B) to separate
        two or more nodes.

    Data

        Boolean

            `yes` or `no`.

        Integer

            C style.

        Real

            C style.

        Nil

            `none`.

        String

            `''` (0x27) or `""` (0x22). Insert a backslash (0x5C) before a
            character to escape from the normal way characters are interpreted,
            for example, a quotation mark.

        Keyword

            As above, used for variables (see <Semantics>).

        Node

            As above, used for expressions (see <Semantics>). Starts with `[`
            (0x5B) and ends with `]` (0x5D).

        List

            As above, used for blocks (see <Semantics>). Starts with `{` (0x7B)
            and ends with `}` (0x7D) or `:` (0x3A) to end with `;` (0x3B).
